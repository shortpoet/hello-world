 CLI command line interface
 LS refers to ls command 
 environment variable -> way to configure environment to be different e.g. $PATH ; CLICOLOR ; LSCOLOR
 bash environment -> where programs execute from, where files are accessed in filesystem 
 echo
 locate after updated 
 source changes e.g. bash_profile 
-->
  <li> $PATH : path refers to directory trees in which executable binary files can be executed from the command line ; specifies where the executables that bash knows about are located </br> .bash_profile is a file (created) that stores paths added to the default ; export PATH="/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/:$PATH" </li>
 
  <li> vim: a text editor for linux written in bash </br> ":" enters command mode; + q = quit ; w = write ; q! = hard quit (no save) (! = bang) (* = splat) "i" enters insert mode </br> copy/paste to vim command+shift+c/v </li>
  <li> vi: predecessor to vim </li>
  <li> Homebrew: package manager for linux environment; basically a packager &#40installer creator&#41 and installer for a software suite and all its dependencies </li>
  <li> Git: distributed version control system for configuration control and form management </br> commands: clone + "filename" = downloads a copy of a version onto the local drive ; status + "filename" = checks to see if snapshot of local filesystem is different from snapshot of latest commit in local repository ; add + "filename" = selects files to add to the snapshot of the local repository ; committ + "filename" = saves the new snapshot based on added files </li>
<!-- Ig successfully uses the word 'meta' in a sentence for the first time in his life.  He did so by suggesting the use of the comment feature of HTML to make notes in my notes.  So here is an example of the example-->
  <li> &ltcode&gt : formats as code </li>
  <li> &ltpre&gt : renders exactly as formatted </li>

  </ul>



<h2> Questions:</h2>
<p> How does this site make its table html code automatically exclude string literals? 
<a href="http://www.theukwebdesigncompany.com/articles/entity-escape-characters.php"> HTML Escape Characters: Complete List</a>
</p>
<p> what is the difference between a &ltdr&gt and &lt/dr&gt ? </p>
<p> why don't i have to escape out the quotation mark characters sometimes? -> when do certain parameters qualify as code and what are the exceptions? </p>
<p> what else gets stored in the .bash_profile file? </p>
